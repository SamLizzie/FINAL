# CLASSIC POKER

## Overview
The following code simulates a classic poker game.

## Programming language
Python

## IDE
Jupyter Notebook was used for the programming of the game.

A program that allows opening ".ipynb" files is recommended to run the code.

## Explanation of the board game
Classic poker is a board game in which a deck of 52 cards is used. In this game, 5 cards are dealt to each player, so the minimum number of players is 2 and the maximum is 9.

## Explanation of the program
In this program there is no interaction between players, nor is it possible to place bets, so each round will immediately determine the winning hand.

- The program is organized by cells. In the first cell are the libraries, packages and modules used in the code, then there are the functions; and, in the last cell is the main code.
- Before running the main code of the "Classic Poker.ipynb" file, each of the cells prior to it must be executed.
- Once the main program has been executed, a menu is displayed in which the existing game options will be displayed. For classic poker it is option 1.
  (For the future in the menu you can add the other two games: Texas Hold em and Omaha hi / lo, once the code is ready for these games)
- Once option 1 has been chosen, the program will ask for the number of players, the cards will be dealt and finally the winning hand will be determined.
- Once the first round in the program is finished, the question is asked if another round is wanted. If Yes, the cards are dealt to the players again and the winning hand is determined again.
- In case another round is not wanted, write the word "No" and it will be redirected to the main menu. Where you have the option to exit (by typing 0) or to return to classic poker with a different number of players.
